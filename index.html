      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>
        Grow A Spine is the PoC of a simulation of a rigid body striving 
        to reach its maximum height potential. The 'Spine' is represented 
        as a series of interconnected rigid bodies, with the last segment 
        (in blue) acting as a fixed anchor. The red segment is subjected 
        to a force vector, random in both magnitude and direction, equivalent 
        to the segment's weight applied at its center of mass. Whenever the 
        red segment attains a new personal height record, the model is 
        adjusted to incorporate a percentage of the force vector that 
        propelled it to the new position for the next iteration. This 
        process continues until either no new record is set after 10,000 
        cycles, or the proportion of the recycled force vector reaches 100%.
